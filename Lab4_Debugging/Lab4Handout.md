# Debugging

1. Try to run the clang Analyzer discussed in the lecture on your coursework code.
2. Look at the provided error.c and try to find the bug that occurs when we enter a non-integer character. You could use the lldb debugger, set breakpoints and investigate the program state to understand the behaviour.

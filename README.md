Report CW1 -> (a) Declare if it is your own work or not; (b) List all known bugs, if any; and (c) If the results of testing with small and large files provided to you matched the expected output or not. Points (b) and (c) should be for running on an STLinux server. If your code works as it should, the report could end up being only a few lines long.
